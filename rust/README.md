# Mastering Rust in A day

## Variables
- Variables are immutable by default.
- You have to explicitly state that you want a variable to be mutable.
- You can redeclare a variable and even have a new type for the redeclaration.
- Constants.

## Data Types
- Scalar and Compound Data Types
- Scaler Data Types (integer, floating-point, char, boolean)
- Compound Data Types (Tuples, Arrays, Strings)

## Control Flow
- `if` statements of course.
- `if` statement is an expression so can be assigned to a variable.
- No `switch` but there is `match` statement.
- `loop`, `while` and `for` statements.
- `loop` statements are expressions and can be assigned to a variable.
- `loop` statements have labels so you can break out of an outer loop
  from and inner loop directly using the label; cool right?
- `for` and `while` as usual bro...
